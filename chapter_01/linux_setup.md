Python is probably already installed on your system. Find out which version is your default by issuing the command `python --version`:

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.3

If you see something like this, Python 2.7 is your default version. You should also see if you have Python 3 installed:

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.2.3

If you have Python 3.4 or later, you should use the installed version. If you have Python 3.3 or earlier, it's probably worth installing Python 3.5.
